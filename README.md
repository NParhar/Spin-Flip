# Spin-Flip
Simulating Simultaneous Spin Flip Using Monte Carlo Methods in Thermal Systems.

The aim of the project is to simulate simultaneous spin flip using Monte Carlo
methods. The two algorithms used throughout the project are called the Metropolis
algorithm and the Single-Cluster Flip algorithm. 

The algorithms were used to simulate spin flip in a thermal system using preset
values such as JkTc= 0.221654.

3 simulations have been created for the two algorithms to model spin flip using
the Ising Model.

One simulation was created using the Metropolis algorithm and the other two were 
for the Single-Cluster Flip algorithms.

The first was used to understand the Ising model and the other two were to
demonstrate understanding of the model; the difference between the latter two is
that the first has a more crude approach whereas the second one has neater code
but sometimes fails, suggesting a bug in the code. These algorithms are
important in Monte Carlo methods and so randomness was explored using a small
program to plot the correlation of consecutive numbers that were randomly generated.
Testing the data was important to ensure code ran smoothly and ‘pandas’ was used to
store the data generated.
